        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <h5>A Software Developer <span> <br> With Multiple Skills </span></h5>
        <p>
          My name is Kevin. I'm a student who is studying in software development and who can write codes to solve some
          of the day-to-day challenges.
          <br />
          <br />
          You can also refer to me as a Python hater, C# fan, or coding dad. I've been using programming languages over
          a year, yet even with that experience, I can learn any programming language in just two days and be at your
          doorstep the next day with a working prototype. I adore programming languages, video games, and Kanye Westâ€”the
          greatest artist of all time.

          <br />
          <br />

          I dislike using my past career to define who I am. The type of work I want to do, defines who I am. I wish to
          continue creating software, websites, and other digital products. Since I only get one chance to demonstrate
          my great coding capabilities, and I would not want to set any limitation to my work.
          <br />
          <br />
          I have an abundance of energy and passion, that I'm more than ready to follow my interests wherever they may
          lead me. I'm a passionate, sociable, multi-talented soul with a built-in capacity to inspire and amuse. I'm
          never satisfied to simply come up with new ideas, and never put them to work. Instead, I feel motivated to
          take action on them pretty much instantly.
