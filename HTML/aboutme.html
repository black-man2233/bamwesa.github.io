        <div class="about-text">
        <p>I'm a 19-year-old student attending Aalborg Tech College specializing in Data TechicÂ with a focus in programming. <br>I code and attend coding classes from several American camps in my spare time. <br>These classes allowed me to learn about the different ways that software developers thought, which inspired me to work toward my goal of becoming a software developer.</p>
          <p>
            With a year of C#,.Net, and WPF programming experience, I've been able to work on projects with API implementation program that would enable data updates without changing the script, both in WPF forms and a console program.<br>
            You can checkout the full list of ny preview and current projects on my <a href="https://github.com/black-man2233" target="_blank">Github</a> or the <a href="/HTML/projects.html">Projects</a> page </p>
        </p>
          <p>
          I dislike using my past career to define who I am. The type of work I want to do, defines who I am. <br>I wish to continue creating software, websites, and other digital products. Since I only get one life to demonstrate
          my great coding capabilities, and I would not want to set any limitation to my work.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have an abundance of energy and passion, that I'm more than ready to follow my interests wherever they may
          lead me. <br> I'm a passionate, sociable, multi-talented soul with a built-in capacity to inspire and amuse. <br>I'm never satisfied to simply come up with new ideas, and never put them to work. Instead, I feel motivated to
          take action on them pretty much instantly.
